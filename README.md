# ToDoApp

This Bloc project introduced DOM events, which allow user actions in the browser to trigger JavaScript method calls. To demonstrate this functionality, we will create a simple to-do app.

# Additional Tasks
Add one more  functionality: a delete button which the user can use to delete to-dos they no longer need.
Import MDL and improve the appearance of your to-do list.
